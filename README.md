# disco Â­ [Discord](https://discord.gg) client for 9Front

Hacked up version of theboxmage's [discord-cli](https://github.com/theboxmage/discordcli)

JSON config is in `$home/lib/disco-cfg.json` for setting password, should be made automatically after first run.

## Install

`mk deps`

`mk install`

## Problems

* JSON

* Does not create accounts for you, this still needs to be done in a browser/app

* Does not support 2FA (Discord API explicitly does not allow this)

* Cutting and pasting text might break things
