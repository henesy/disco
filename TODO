Commands:

:r -- register via Register(email)

:d [n] file -- dump backlog of last 'n' msgs to a file 'file'

:m needs fixed

Features:

* read $home/lib/discord.face for profile picture (or just face?)

* runtime verify proper permissions -rw------- 0600 for discord.ndb

* flag for larger backlog loading (similar to :m, which is broken atm)

* CAPTCHA solution -- http-proxy is a bad one

* refine :p and its menu
	* when leaving a pm, drops back to channel dialogue from last guild (feature?)

* fix :m not displaying more than loaded backlog

* fix ctrl+d not closing out cleanly (treat the same as :q)

* add [b] go back to pm's menu from within pm's rather than the :c menu for last guild
